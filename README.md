# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

##### The purpose of this school district analysis was to first remove the freshman at Thomas High School reading and math scores from the main data frame due to some academic integrity issues. This will change my previous analysis I have constructed in the PyCitySchools python file which includes Thomas High School freshman math and reading test scores. In a brief disucssion, with this new analysis I have createdn the follwing with the math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School and without them:

    1.A District summary Data frame
    2.A School summary dataframe
    3.The top 5 and bottom 5 schoools based on overall passing rate
    4.The average math score for each grade level from each school
    5.The average reading score for each grade level from each school
    6.The math and reading scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type

Relative to other schools, Thomas High School dropped significantly considering it was one of the best high school in the district at the number 2 spot based overall passing both math and reading. Now it is the 8th best out of 15 other schools.
